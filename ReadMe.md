Source code for an additive synthesizer VST with per-partial envelope control, and a Python interface for generating control data for the synth programatically.

The code for the synthesizer is written with C++ and the JUCE framework.

Python scripts for generating control data for the synth are in extras folder

For more details on the synthesizer and a video of it in action, please visit http://gabrielbrown.net/blog/EnvSynth/index.html

This is not currently meant to be a public release, but someone familiar with Juce or someone sufficiently motivated can compile the code. Juce libraries are not included here and need to be downloaded separately.
